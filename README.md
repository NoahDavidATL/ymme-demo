# YMM Demo
**Scenario**: A junior developer was tasked with rewriting our year-make-model dropdown in React, but got pulled to another project before it was able to be completed. It is now up to you to complete this new assignment. A sample of the completed functionality can be found on AutoZone.com -> Add vehicle (ignore the "engine" dropdown).

## Acceptance Criteria
 - [ ] Populate the Year, Make, and Model `<select>` using the given api functions. These functions may need modification in order to operate.
 - [ ] Only enable the `Make <select>` when the `Year <select>` has been selected. Note: Default values do not count.
 - [ ] Only enable the `Model <select>` when the `Make <select>` has been selected. Note: Default values do not count.
 - [ ] **Advanced**: Create a reusable component to manage the described `<select>` functionality.
 - [ ] **Advanced**: Ensure proper A11Y/ADA considerations have been given to the components.
