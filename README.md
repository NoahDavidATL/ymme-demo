# YMM Demo
**Scenario**: A junior developer was tasked with rewriting our year-make-model dropdown in React, but got pulled to another project before it was able to be completed. It is now up to you to complete this new assignment. A sample of the completed functionality can be found on AutoZone.com -> Add vehicle (ignore the "engine" dropdown). You can refer to the image below:
